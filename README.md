# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`CNN.ipynb`) implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for deep learning tasks. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **notebooks/CNN.ipynb** – Main notebook containing the full pipeline (data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation).
- **data/dataset** – Dataset folder 

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN architecture built using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, depending on implementation)
- Model training with configurable hyperparameters
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix, etc.)
- Option to save and load trained models

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Python 3.8+
```
Requirements include:
1. TensorFlow / PyTorch

2. NumPy

3. Pandas

4. Matplotlib / Seaborn

5. scikit-learn

## Usage

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CNN-Project.git
cd CNN-Project
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook CNN.ipynb
```

Run the notebook cells to train and evaluate the CNN.


## 📊 Results
